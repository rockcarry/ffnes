1b Acronyms
-----------

	You may not find these words in the doc but you'll find find them around the nesdev community.

	APU:                Audio Processing Unit, what most people refer to the PSG in the 2A03.

	Chrrom/chrram:      Character rom/ram. This is holds the tile set rom/ram which is located on cart. All carts
	                    must have at least 8k of this (for both set 0 & 1) or writing to mirror through out the 8k.

	CPU:                The 2A03 which holds the 6502, most people do not refer the PSG when they mention this.

	DMA:                Direct Memory Access.

	HBlank:             Horizontal Blank, a time during rendering where the the scanline being draw is finished
	                    and video ram is not being used.

	Mappers/Memory Maps: A usually small chip that redirect wires based on infomation fed to it. This can be used
	                    to switch prgrom wram, chrrom and other things located on cart.

	NSF:                NES Sound Format. Holds various music and sound effects.

	PPU:                Picture Processing Unit, the 2C02.
	prgrom:             Program rom. Which is located at $8000-FFFF, and could be switched in & out

	PSG:                Programmable Sound Generator. Its built into the A203 chip along with the modified 6502.

	Sprram              Sprite Ram, located inside of the 2C02.

	W/S Ram:            Work / Save ram. Extra ram located at $6000-7FFF for general use. If it is batter packed it
	                    is refered as save ram. May be switchable depending on the cart.

	VBlank:             Vertical blank. This happens after the video is finished being drawn and video
	                    memory is free to access.

2b General Information
----------------------
	The NTSC NES uses a chip called 2A03 which holds a modified NMOS 6502 CPU with a PSG built into the die.
	The PAL NES holds a 2A07 which has some minor changes.

	The modified 6502 lack the standard decimal mode. For information about 6502 instructions,
	addressing and opcodes or cycle by cycle steps, Look for 6502.txt, 6502_cpu.txt at nesdev
	(http://nesdev.parodius.com/ or http://nesdev.com/) and drop by http://www.6502.org/

	For technical information about the 2A03 look for Brad Taylor's excellent document called "2A03
	technical reference" which covers absolutely everything about the chip. The speed of the CPU on NTSC
	is 1.7897725 MHz and 1.6626070 MHz for PAL. The CPU run exactly 341/3(NTSC) and 341/3.2 (PAL) cycles
	per scanline. Below is some general information to help you understand the 6502 better.

2c Interrupts
-------------

	The 6502 has 3 in Interrupts each of them jump to an address based on their vectors.
	The address is 2 bytes long with the low byte first.

	$FFFA: NMI
	$FFFC: RESET
	$FFFE: IRQ/BRK

	Non-Maskable Interruption (NMI):
	      Pushes Flags, set I flag then jump, 7 cycles long.
	      It is triggered when reg $2000.7 is set when the PPU hits vblank.
	      If you clear $2000.7 then set it while $2002.7 is still set, (look at PPU regs) you can trigger
	      another NMI. NMI is used to jump to code that updates the screen or time somthing.

	Reset:
	      Jumps to Address. This happens when you hit the reset button on the NES hardware, or when you
	      turn on your NES. This can also happen if you run a bad opcode, not all-bad opcodes will cause a
	      reset but they may cause one. You should wait 2 VBlanks so everything can get in sync.

	Interrupt ReQuest (IRQ):
	      if the I flag is cleared, IRQ pushes the Flags, set the I flag and spends 7 cycles doing it.
	      If the I flag is already set nothing will happen. Based on what is causing the IRQ it may be
	      fired regularly until it is acknowledged (usually in the IRQ code).

	      It is usually timed for mid frame tricks or to regulate something such as sound.

	Break (BRK):
	      Pushes Flags with the B flag set. Then sets the I flag, it is 7 cycles long.
	      This is caused when the 6502 runs the instruction BRK which is 2 bytes long.
	      The 2nd byte of BRK is not used in any way, usually set a specific value for debugging
	      purposes. This Instruction shares vectors with IRQ and is mostly used for debugging.

	      NOTE: The B flag does not exist in the 6502 Status flags. The bit is only pushed, when read in
	      It is cleared.

2d Registers
------------

DMA (Direct Memory Access, $4014):
	The DMA is activated when a value is written to $4014. It reads a value at AABB then
	writes it to $2004. AA is the value written to $4014 and BB is the current write number from 0 to FF.
	Reading and writing a byte takes one CPU cycle each. It does this 256 times thus being 512
	CPU cycles long. Most if not all games write $00 to $2003 before writing to the DMA. The DMA purpose
	is to update the PPU's sprram quickly during the precious vblank time.


Input Ports ($4016 / $4017):
	$4016 (port 1)
	$4017 (port 2)

	The NES has 2 ports to plug in your peripheral device (pad, light zapper, etc).
	You can read the both ports through the $4016 and $4017. Both ports has the highest 2 bits opened,
	bit 5 is 0 and rest (bits 4-0) are read in from the port. Writing to the $4016 sends the
	written value to both ports. Meanwhile writes to the $4017 will go to the APU.
	Read the input section below to learn more about available device.

2e Notes
--------
	- The chip does *not* support decimal mode.
	- May or may not reset on bad opcodes. Unexpected behaviours may happen
	- Read Modify Write instructions (inc, asl etc) will read, write back the same value then
	  modify and write the right value to the memory address. Beware of the dummy write.
	- Any kind of Index will have a dummy read before fixing high address byte
	- BRK is 2 bytes
	- Wraps around in the zero page (zp index X, Y, Indirect X, and Indirect Y)
	- Wraps around on indirect instructions
	        (JMP)  $89FF                      LDA ($FF), Y (Y=3)
	        $8900: $A2                        $0000: $9A
	        $89FF: $3C                        $00FF: $24
	        $8A00: $78                        $0100: $72
	        PC = $A23C                        A = $9A24 + Y ($9A27)

3b Tile set
-----------
	Tile sets hold 8x8 pixel tiles used to draw pictures on screen.
	It is located inside of the cart and may be switched at any given time depending on the cartridge.
	The tiles hold 2 bits per pixel which give you 16 byte per tile.
	Each tile set holds 256 tiles which will result in 4k ($1000 or 4096) per set. There are two tile
	sets, normally one set is for the sprites while the other is for the background (nametable).
	Sprite can be 8x16 pixels in which case the NES will allow sprites to access both tile sets.

	Cleared  bits:                          '.'
	Set bits (low  at First  8 bytes):      '*'
	Set bits (high at Second 8 bytes):      '-'
	Combine bits (value 3):                 '#'

	byte 0: *.....*.        *.....*.        clear bits '.' are considered transparent
	byte 1: **....*.        #*....#.        so when this happens, you draw the pixel
	byte 2: *.*...*.        #-*...#.        behind It. 
	byte 3: *..*..*.        #.-*..#.        High priority sprites -> Nametable ->
	byte 4: *...*.*.        #..-*.#.        Low priority sprites -> Colour #0
	byte 5: *....**.        #...-*#.        The left side is drawn over the right side. But special cases
	byte 6: *.....*.        #....-#.        will disable pixels or change priority.
	byte 7: ........        -.....-.

	byte 8: ........
	byte 9: -.....-.
	byte A: --....-.
	byte B: -.-...-.
	byte C: -..-..-.
	byte D: -...-.-.
	byte E: -....--.
	byte F: -.....-.

	The tiles above will have a second pair of bits to select the type of palette.
	If the tile is for a name table the bits will be found in the 'attribute' part of the tables.
	If the tile is used for a sprite the high 2 bits will be found inside the sprite ram.

3c Name Tables
--------------

	The name tables are used to select tiles for the background. Each table can hold 32x30 tiles
	which make a resolution of 256x240. Each byte selects a tile while the end of the table holds the
	colour attributes. The high 2 bits for the tiles selected will select the palette we are using
	(at $3F00-3F0F) they can be found at the end of the name table at $3C0 (32*30 = 960)
	Each byte in the attribute section affects 16 tiles.


	00 01 | 02 03 .... 1C 1D | 1E 1F        the 2x2 tiles at each corner get their
	20 21 | 22 23 .... 3C 3D | 3E 3F        2 high bits from the appropriate bit.
	------+------ .... ------+------              %AABB CCDD        DD | CC
	40 41 | 42 43 .... 5C 5D | 5E 5F                                ---+---
	60 61 | 62 63 .... 7C 7D | 7E 7F                                BB | AA

	$2001.3:        (V)isibility. If cleared the PPU stops drawing data from the name-tables.
	$2001.1:        (C)lipping. If cleared the left 8 pixels of the name-table will be ignored.

	Note: on a NTSC screen the top 8 & bottom 8 pixels are not visible.


3d Name Tables
    Mirroring
--------------

	The NES has 2k of ram for nametables internally (which gives you 2 tables).
	Using A10 & A11 of the PPU you can control the mirroring or give it extra tables.

	A11 A10

	0   0       $2000, $2400, $2800, $2C00 are all pointed at the first k of ram.

	0   1       $2000, $2400 are pointing to the first k while $2800, $2C00 are pointing
	            to the 2nd k. This causes horizontal mirroring

	1   0       $2000, $2800 are pointing to the first k while $2400, $2C00 are pointing to the
	            2nd k. This causes vertical mirroring (the table above/below are the same)

	1   1       $2000 is pointed to the first k, $2400 is pointed to the second k.
	            $2800 & $2C00 are pointing to 2k of ram (or ROM) inside of the cart.

	Check out brad taylors doc for technical infomation.

3e Palette
----------

	The NES has $20 bytes of palette data mapped to $3F00-3FFF
	You can easily get the true address by doing an AND with $1F
	Address 00-0F is for name-tables while 10-1F is for sprites.

	As mentioned before when the tile low 2 bit is 0 the pixel is transparent the PPU only has room
	for 4 sets of 3 palettes for name-tables & sprites.
	When the colour is %xx00 the PPU either draws the pixel behind of the current pixel of it or
	draws colour #0 when there is none. Colour #0 can be set by writing to $3Fx0.

        0123 4567 89AB CDEF        (u)nused, (a)cknowledged, (c)olour #0, (m)irror of above
0       caaa uaaa uaaa uaaa        name-tables
1       Maaa Maaa Maaa Maaa        sprites

	These bits are converted to colour, the colours are analog and do not convert to a consistent RGB
	palette. The PPU only has room for 6 bits in its palette section so you can only output a range of
	64 colours plus emphasis for some output change.

	$2001.5-7, .0        %BGRx xxxM

	Thanks to Chris Covell for this info.

	When (M)onochrome is set bits 0-3 is ignored which only leaves you with the highest 2 bits (5 & 6)
	This leaves you with some white & light grey colours.

While Reading:
	Reading the palette via $2007 bypasses the VRAM read buffer and immediately returns the correct data.
	However, the VRAM read buffer will still be updated but, with the data mirrored from $2F00-$2FFF
	rather than internal palette data. Palette RAM is only 6 bits wide; the upper 2 bits will always read back as 0.

	Also while the palette being read with M set, you will read from 3Fx0 and the low 4 bits will be
	cleared. Monochrome will not affect Writing in any way.

3f Sprite Ram
-------------
	The PPU has exactly 256 bytes for sprite ram. Each sprite needs 4 bytes of data so that leaves you
	with a maximum of 64 sprites. Sprite ram can access by $2003, $2004 & $4014

	Byte:
	0: %YYYY YYYY Axis Y from top of the screen.
	1: %TTTT TTTT Tile Index
	2: %vhp- --cc 
	        v:        Vertical flip
	        h:        Horizontal flip
	        p:        sprite priority, 0=High priority, in front of nametables 1= Low pri, behind hametables
	        ---:      unknown/not used
	        cc:       high 2 bits for tiles
	3: %XXXX XXXX Axis X from left side of the screen

Other Affecting Registers:
	$2000 %--S- T---
	        Sprite (S)ize 8x16
	        (T)ile table 1xxx
	$2001 %---V -C--
	        Sprites are (V)isble
	        (C)lip sprite pixels if fall in left 8 pixel of the screen
	$2002 %-HO- ----
	        Sprite #0 pixel (H)it
	        Sprite (O)verflow (9+ found on scanline)

	If $2000.5 (S) is set (8x16 sprites) the lowest bit decides the Tile Table instead of 2000.3 (T).
	Since the low bit controls the table you can only use even numbered tiles which is good since all odds
	would be the low 8x8 of the 8x16 tiles.

	When sprite #0 draws a pixel and the BG also drew a pixel there, sprite collision (H)it is set ($2002.6).
	Only 8 sprite can be drawn on screen, if a 9th sprite is found on the same scanline bit
	$2002.5 (O) is set. The first 8 sprites found will be drawn. If 2 sprites are drawn at the same
	position the sprite lower (closer to sprite #0) will be drawn on top.

	Note on collision:
	      If the pixel hits at $FF (Right most of the screen) it will not be considered as a successful hit
	      and will NOT set the collision bit ($2002.6)

	Note on priority:
	      If two or more sprites occupy the same pixel position, the sprite with lowest number is drawn.
	      If a high and low priority sprite are drawn at the same position, high priority sprite pixel will
	      be considered low priority.

	Note on sprram:
	      After you write data to it, you must regulary refresh it by write data over it. If you take too long
	      to refresh the data the bytes which you haven't written on will change to an unknown value.

Registers to Access sprite-ram:
	$2003:  Write Only: Sets the offset in sprite ram.
	$2004:  Reads or writes the value in sprite ram using $2003 as an offset.
	        Increase offset value by 1 on writes, does not increase on reads.

	$4014:  Sprite DMA which is a CPU register. It is write only.
	        It will read XX00 + I (where XX is the value and I is 0-FF) and feed the value to $2004.
	        It takes 512 cycles and is a lot better then looping writes by code.

3g Scrolling
------------
	Thanks to Loopy for all of this info.

	Temp:           register/latch to hold scrolling info which is copied to address on line 21.
	Address:        The 15 bits that $2007 use to sent writes to the PPU
	Fine X:         3 bits uses to control the name-tables fine x during rendering.
	Toggle:         a bit that is flipped between write 1 & 2 for the $2005 & 6.

	NN              Name-table Bits. High is the Vertical bit, low is the Horizontal bit
	YYYYY           Tile Y
	XXXXX           Tile X
	yyy             Fine Y        


	PPU Address during rendering        %-yyy NNYY   YYYX XXXX


	$2000 W %---- --NN
	temp    %---- NN--   ---- ----

	$2002 R toggle = 0 

$2005   W %XXXX Xxxx (toggle is cleared)

	temp        %0--- ----   ---X XXXX
	Fine X      %xxx
	toggle = 1

$2005   W %YYYY Yyyy (toggle is set)
	temp        %0yyy --YY   YYY- ----
	toggle = 0

Total bits affected with $2005:
	temp        %0yyy --YY   YYYX XXXX



$2006   W %--yy NNYY (toggle is cleared)
	temp        %00yy NNYY   ---- ----

$2006   W %YYYX XXXX (toggle is set)
	temp        %0--- ----   YYYX XXXX
	address = temp

Total bits affected with $2006:
	temp        %00yy NNYY   YYYX XXXX
	address = temp

	As you can see above, $2006 can change every bit in the temp, but unfortunately it
	will clear the high fine Y bit. You can set the Fine X,Y & Tile X, Y with $2005 but you
	need a write to $2000 (or write $2006 then $2005) to change the name-table bits

3h Rendering
------------
	Check out brad Taylor's doc for full information about rendering.
	Here is my simpler explanation of it.

	Fine X controls what pixel to start rendering from (0-7). After drawing one bit the NES increase fine
	X, when it wraps from 7 to 0 Tile X is then increase to get to the next tile. When tile X wraps from
	31 to 0, the Tile Y is not increase, but the low bit of the 2 nametable bits is flipped. This effect
	allows the PPU to skip the Tiles in the next row and jump to the next name-table.

	Fine Y is increase at the end of every line. After Fine Y wraps from 7 to 0 the Tile Y is increased.
	Unlike tile X, tile Y does not wrap from 31 to 0, it wraps from 29 to 0 so it will not read from its
	attribute bits. (remember screen is 240 pixels high. 30 tile * 8 pixel per tile = 240)

	When Tile Y wrap from 29 to 0 it flips the high name-table bit. If Tile Y is set to 30 or 31 from
	$2006, it will wrap from 31 to 0 but the high name-table bit will not flip

	Line 0: Junk/Refresh
	    This line clears bits $2002.5-7. Also throws away all the sprite data.
	    The PPU Address copies the PPU's temp at the beginning of the line if sprite or name-tables
	    are visible.

	    It is unknown if this line affects the PPU like 1-241, according to my emulator, decreasing the MMC 3
	    scanline counter causes problems. Maybe the point of it is to destory all sprite objects.

	Line 1-241:
	    Renders the screen for 240 lines, at the end of each line it increases Fine Y and gets the low NT
	    bit, fine X & Tile X position from PPU's temp.

	Line 242: Dead/Junk
	    Does nothing but run.

	Line 243 - 262(NTSC) - 312(PAL): VBlank
	    At the beginning of line 0 bit $2002.7 is set. If $2000.7 is also set a hardware NMI occurs.
	    you can access the PPU any time without corrupting data.

	Note: If $2001.3 & 4 is cleared (sprite & name-tables not visible) you can access the PPU without
	      corrupting data, as if it were in VBlank.

	      A few games changes the palette and jump to the next nametable. This is done by turning off the ppu
	      usually at the end of the line (HBlank) writing to the palette, then setting the address to the
	      location it want to start from. Turning off the ppu will destory the sprites for the next scanline.

	      You have exactly (341-256(pixels)) / 3(NTSC) or 3.2(PAL) cpu cycle for HBlank.


3i Data Transfer
---------------

	Register $2007 is the only way for the NES to read & write data in the PPU's Memory map. The PPU's
Address controls where the value is written too. To set the address you must write to $2006 while the toggle
is set (2nd $2005/6 write) which copies the temp to the address. When reading or writing to $2007 the
address is increased by 1 or 32 based on $2000.2.

	When reading Address $0000 - $2FFF from $2007 the value return is the *last* value read from the PPU.
So if you were to set the Address to $2000 and start reading the nametable bytes, the first byte would be
whatever you last *read* and the next read will be the byte at $2000. however, if the Read if $3F00 - $3FFF
(palette), you will get the palette byte right away, the value at 2xxx will replace the pipe value which
you will receive the next time you read from 0-3EFF.

4a General Information
----------------------
	The NES has many types of input, Ranging from the power pad to the light zapper.
	Here are all the known inputs and all the info I can get from them.
	$4016 & $4017

	Reads
	%oo0i ieei
	        oo  open bus, will be the last bit read in (high byte of PC)
	        iii input device, if no input is available it gets the expansion port bits
	        ee  expansion port
            
	writes
	%ss-- -eea on write
	        ss if writing to $4017 you can set 2 sound bits mention in sound docs.
	        ee expansion port
	        (a)ll ports (expansion, input 1 and 2) get this bit.
	        - unused (0's)

Note:       NTSC and PAL NES do not have any games or peripherals that uses the
	        expansion port (or its bits). 

4b Joypad
----------
	The NES standard pad. While plugged in $4016 & $4017 you should reset the shift register in both pads
	before reading. To do this you write 1 to the lowest bit in $4016, which will set the latch inside of
	the pad connect	to any port. When the latch is set the shift register will be brought down to the first
	avaible bit and	this will constally done until you clear the latch. (write 0 to low bit in $4016).

	After reading $4016 or $4017 the shift register will move to the next button. The lowest bit will hold the
	button state. If the bit is set the button is currently being held. The order of the buttons are

	A B Select Start Up Down Left Right

	A would be the first bit you read and Right would be the 8th. After these 8 reads the rest of the bit will
	be set (on normal pads). To get player 2 input you would use the lowest bit from $4017.

4c 4 Player Adapter
----------------
	This is used the same way as the joy pad except after the 8 reads from $4016 you will get the 8 bits
	from player 3 which is in the same order. Player 4 input will be the next 8 from $4017. To reset the
	strobing to all 4 player you do the same writes to $4016.


4d Light Zapper
---------------
	The light zapper uses 2 of the 6 bits. %TW--0
	T is the Trigger, is set if it's pressed else it is cleared.
	W this is White detection. All games set the target area to white and the rest to black to avoid any
	colour confusion due to colours & light in the room.

4e Paddles
----------
	To be written

4f Power Pad
------------
	To be written


+-------------+
| NES Formats |
+-------------+

5a iNes Header:

	Every emulator supports the iNes format and many games images use it.
	There are docs that include extended infomation in the reserve section but i have not
	heard or any image that uses one. This format listed is supported in every emulator i know of
